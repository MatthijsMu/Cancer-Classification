# Cancer Classification
 A small Data Mining project where we fit (1) a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier and (2) a multilayer perceptron classifier. A report regarding the feature selection, cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning is included together with the  Jupyter  notebook for the fit of the naive Bayes classifier. The Wisconsin breast cancer dataset is also included in the subdirectory "archive"
